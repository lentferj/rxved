"""Console-script entry points, which check the shared library is installed.

``rxved`` and its sibling tools share one library, ``vinsynlib``. It is an
ordinary installation dependency, and the ordinary way for a dependency to
be missing is that somebody pulled the source without reinstalling.

Without this module the failure is a bare ``ModuleNotFoundError`` raised
from inside a module-level ``import`` -- a traceback naming a package the
user never asked for, with no hint of what to do about it. Worse on Windows,
where a console script exits before the traceback can be read.

This is the one place that can say something useful, because it runs before
any module that imports the library. It is deliberately tiny, and it must
keep importing nothing but the standard library.
