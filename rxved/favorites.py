"""The local favourites database.

The one piece of state in rxved that is genuinely the **user's** rather than
the device's or Roland's, which is why it gets a real database rather than
another key in ``config.toml``. Three things follow from that:

**It is keyed on the slot, not on the name.** A row records ``PST-B`` number
29, never "Amber Wash" -- so a favourite survives the user renaming a USER
patch, and so a favourite of a *preset* slot means the slot, permanently.
The name is stored too, but only as a label to show when the catalog is
missing; it is never the identity.

**It is SQLite, and that is not over-engineering for a list of favourites.**
A JSON file rewritten on every toggle loses the whole file to a crash or a
full disk mid-write, and the natural next features -- ratings, tags, notes,
"when did I last use this" -- are all things a flat file grows badly. SQLite
gives atomic writes for free. The schema is versioned from the first commit
so the second version does not have to guess what the first one wrote.

**It lives outside the project directory by default**, in the per-platform
application-*data* directory -- see :func:`data_dir` for where that is on
each and why. Unlike ``config.toml``, which is a disposable cache of which
MIDI port answered last and lives in the working directory, favourites are
the user's own work: the one thing here worth backing up, and the one thing
that must not be lost to a ``git clean`` in a checkout. The sibling projects
keep their bench data in-tree and explicitly note the risk that creates;
this does not repeat it.

    """The per-platform directory for this application's **data**.

    Data, not configuration: the distinction is real on every platform and
    matters here, because favourites are the user's own work — the one thing
    in this project worth backing up — while ``config.toml`` is a cache of
    which MIDI port answered last and is disposable.

    * **Windows** — ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\\rxved`` (typically
      ``C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\rxved``).

      Local rather than Roaming deliberately. ``%APPDATA%`` roams, and a
      roaming profile copies files wholesale at logon and logoff; a SQLite
      database caught mid-write by that copy, or opened on two machines at
      once against one synced file, is a known way to corrupt one. SQLite's
      own documentation warns against network filesystems for the same
      reason. Roaming would be the right answer for a small settings file
      and is the wrong one for a database.

    * **macOS** — ``~/Library/Application Support/rxved``, which is where
      Apple's File System Programming Guide puts application data that is
      not a cache and not a user document.

    * **Linux, BSD, everything else** — the XDG Base Directory
      Specification: ``$XDG_DATA_HOME/rxved``, falling back to
      ``~/.local/share/rxved``. Note that XDG requires ``XDG_DATA_HOME`` to
      be an **absolute** path and says a relative one must be ignored, so a
      stray relative value falls back rather than creating a directory
      wherever the process happens to have been started.

    Every branch falls back to the XDG layout if the platform's own
    environment variable is missing, which is what happens on a stripped
    Windows service account or a macOS process with no HOME. A wrong-looking
    but writable path beats raising on startup, since the alternative is a
    browser that will not open because it cannot decide where to put a file
    the user may never use.
