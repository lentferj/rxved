"""The suite must not write the application's config into the checkout.

``xv.config.DEFAULT_CONFIG_PATH`` is the relative string ``"config.toml"``.
That is the right default for the application -- it is a disposable
per-checkout cache of which port answered last, gitignored, as distinct from
the favourites store, which is the user's own work and lives in the platform
data directory. It is the wrong thing for a test, which would drop the file
into whatever directory pytest was started from.

Being gitignored is what makes this worth a test rather than a habit: the
file never appears in ``git status``, so the only evidence is somebody
noticing it sitting next to the source.

Both checks below were this file's own AST walk, copied into each project in
the family. They are now one call each into :mod:`vinsynlib.devchecks`.
